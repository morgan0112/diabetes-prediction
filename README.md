# Diabetes Detection

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of mortality and reduced life expectancy.

Our aim is to assist medical professionals in early predictions of the disease in patients by using and analysing medical health records.

To achieve this, machine learning will be used to find patterns to detect early signs of diabetes.


## Summary
Finding a way to assist medical professionals to detect early signs of diabetes but using a machine learning model to predict the current state of a patient. 
This model was deployed into a Django web application to help patients identify their current condition based on their current medical records.

Pre-diabetes is the entry point of patients developing diabetes therefore patients who got a prediction of pre-diabetes can take measures before complications 
occurs that can leave them in a weakened state.

#### The model was deployed to a Django web application and can be trained continuously on new data.
