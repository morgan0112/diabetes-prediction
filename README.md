# Diabetes Analysis

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of mortality and reduced life expectancy.

Our aim is to assist medical professionals in early predictions of the disease in patients by using and analysing medical health records.

To achieve this, machine learning will be used to find patterns to detect early signs of diabetes.

## What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. 
Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. 
Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. 
Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. 
Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

## Summary
Finding a way to assist medical professionals to detect early signs of diabetes but using a machine learning model to predict the current state of a patient. 
This model can be deployed into a web application and helps patients identify their current state based on their current medical records.

Pre-diabetes is the entry point of patients developing diabetes therefore patients who got a predict of pre-diabetes can take measures before complications 
occurs that can leave them in a weakened state.
